| Properties |
| --- |
| includedPrimaryTypes | Notice: Available only in the v=alpha channel. Type:  Array<string> optional Included primary Place type (for example, "restaurant" or "gas_station").  A Place is only returned if its primary type is included in this list. Up to 5 values can be specified. If no types are specified, all Place types are returned. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete included-primary-types="type1 type2 type3..."></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| includedRegionCodes | Notice: Available only in the v=alpha channel. Type:  Array<string> optional Only include results in the specified regions, specified as up to 15 CLDR two-character region codes. An empty set will not restrict the results. If both locationRestriction and includedRegionCodes are set, the results will be located in the area of intersection. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete included-region-codes="c1 c2 c3..."></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| locationBias | Type:  LocationBias optional A soft boundary or hint to use when searching for places. |
| locationRestriction | Type:  LocationRestriction optional Bounds to constrain search results. |
| name | Type:  string optional The name to be used for the input element. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#name for details. Follows the same behavior as the name attribute for inputs. Note that this is the name that will be used when a form is submitted. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form for details. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete name="string"></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| origin | Notice: Available only in the v=alpha channel. Type:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral\|LatLngAltitude\|LatLngAltitudeLiteral optional The origin from which to calculate distance. If not specified, distance is not calculated. The altitude, if given, is not used in the calculation. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete origin="lat,lng\|lat,lng,altitude"></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| requestedLanguage | Type:  string optional A language identifier for the language in which the results should be returned, if possible. Results in the selected language may be given a higher ranking, but suggestions are not restricted to this language. See the list of supported languages. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete requested-language="string"></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| requestedRegion | Type:  string optional A region code which is used for result formatting and for result filtering. It does not restrict the suggestions to this country. The region code accepts a ccTLD ("top-level domain") two-character value. Most ccTLD codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is "uk" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is "gb" (technically for the entity of "The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"). HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete requested-region="string"></gmp-place-autocomplete> |
| unitSystem | Notice: Available only in the v=alpha channel. Type:  UnitSystem optional The unit system used to display distances. If not specified, the unit system is determined by requestedRegion. HTML attribute: <gmp-place-autocomplete unit-system="metric\|imperial"></gmp-place-autocomplete> |

For migration purposes, specify both this property and includeRegionCodes. Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  ComponentRestrictions optional The component restrictions. Component restrictions are used to restrict predictions to only those within the parent component. For example, the country. |
| types | Deprecated: This property will continue to function in the beta channel, but will not be made available in alpha or at release. For migration purposes, specify both this property and includedPrimaryTypes. Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel. Type:  Array<string> optional The types of predictions to be returned.

If there is any additional text in the prediction-item, it is outside prediction-item-main-text and inherits its styling from prediction-item. It is colored gray by default. The additional text is typically an address. |
| prediction-item-match | The part of the returned prediction that matches the user’s input. By default, this matched text is highlighted in bold text. Note that the matched text may be anywhere within prediction-item. It is not necessarily part of prediction-item-main-text. |
