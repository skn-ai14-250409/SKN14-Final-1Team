OverlayView [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/overlay-view#OverlayView]
class

google.maps.OverlayView
class

You can implement this class if you want to display custom types of overlay objects on the map. Inherit from this class by setting your overlay's prototype: MyOverlay.prototype = new google.maps.OverlayView();. The OverlayView constructor is guaranteed to be an empty function. You must implement three methods: onAdd(), draw(), and onRemove().  In the onAdd() method, you should create DOM objects and append them as children of the panes. In the draw() method, you should position these elements. In the onRemove() method, you should remove the objects from the DOM.  You must call setMap() with a valid Map object to trigger the call to the onAdd() method and setMap(null) in order to trigger the onRemove() method. The setMap() method can be called at the time of construction or at any point afterward when the overlay should be re-shown after removing. The draw() method will then be called whenever a map property changes that could change the position of the element, such as zoom, center, or map type.
This class extends
MVCObject [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/event#MVCObject].

Access by calling const {OverlayView} = await google.maps.importLibrary("maps") or const {OverlayView} = await google.maps.importLibrary("streetView"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constructor |
| --- |
| OverlayView | OverlayView() Parameters:  None Creates an OverlayView. |
| Static Methods |
| --- |
| preventMapHitsAndGesturesFrom | preventMapHitsAndGesturesFrom(element) Parameters:  element:  Element Return Value:  None Stops click, tap, drag, and wheel events on the element from bubbling up to the map. Use this to prevent map dragging and zooming, as well as map "click" events. |
| preventMapHitsFrom | preventMapHitsFrom(element) Parameters:  element:  Element Return Value:  None Stops click or tap on the element from bubbling up to the map. Use this to prevent the map from triggering "click" events. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| draw | draw() Parameters:  None Return Value:  None Implement this method to draw or update the overlay. Use the position from projection.fromLatLngToDivPixel() to correctly position the overlay relative to the MapPanes. This method is called after onAdd(), and is called on change of zoom or center. It is not recommended to do computationally expensive work in this method. |
| getMap | getMap() Parameters:  None Return Value:  Map\|StreetViewPanorama |
| getPanes | getPanes() Parameters:  None Return Value:  MapPanes\|null Returns the panes in which this OverlayView can be rendered. The panes are not initialized until onAdd is called by the API. |
| getProjection | getProjection() Parameters:  None Return Value:  MapCanvasProjection Returns the MapCanvasProjection object associated with this OverlayView. The projection is not initialized until onAdd is called by the API. |
| onAdd | onAdd() Parameters:  None Return Value:  None Implement this method to initialize the overlay DOM elements. This method is called once after setMap() is called with a valid map. At this point, panes and projection will have been initialized. |
| onRemove | onRemove() Parameters:  None Return Value:  None Implement this method to remove your elements from the DOM. This method is called once following a call to setMap(null). |
| setMap | setMap(map) Parameters:  map:  Map\|StreetViewPanorama optional The map or panorama. If null, the layer will be removed. Return Value:  None Adds the overlay to the map or panorama. |
| Inherited: addListener, bindTo, get, notify, set, setValues, unbind, unbindAll |

MapPanes [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/overlay-view#MapPanes]
interface

google.maps.MapPanes
interface

| Properties |
| --- |
| floatPane | Type:  Element This pane contains the info window. It is above all map overlays. (Pane 4). |
| mapPane | Type:  Element This pane is the lowest pane and is above the tiles. It does not receive DOM events. (Pane 0). |
| markerLayer | Type:  Element This pane contains markers. It does not receive DOM events. (Pane 2). |
| overlayLayer | Type:  Element This pane contains polylines, polygons, ground overlays and tile layer overlays. It does not receive DOM events. (Pane 1). |
| overlayMouseTarget | Type:  Element This pane contains elements that receive DOM events. (Pane 3). |

MapCanvasProjection [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/3.61/overlay-view#MapCanvasProjection]
interface

google.maps.MapCanvasProjection
interface

This object is made available to the OverlayView from within the draw method. It is not guaranteed to be initialized until draw is called.
| Methods |
| --- |
| fromContainerPixelToLatLng | fromContainerPixelToLatLng(pixel[, noClampNoWrap]) Parameters:  pixel:  Point optional noClampNoWrap:  boolean optional Return Value:  LatLng\|null Computes the geographical coordinates from pixel coordinates in the map's container. |
| fromDivPixelToLatLng | fromDivPixelToLatLng(pixel[, noClampNoWrap]) Parameters:  pixel:  Point optional noClampNoWrap:  boolean optional Return Value:  LatLng\|null Computes the geographical coordinates from pixel coordinates in the div that holds the draggable map. |
| fromLatLngToContainerPixel | fromLatLngToContainerPixel(latLng) Parameters:  latLng:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral Return Value:  Point\|null Computes the pixel coordinates of the given geographical location in the map's container element. |
| fromLatLngToDivPixel | fromLatLngToDivPixel(latLng) Parameters:  latLng:  LatLng\|LatLngLiteral optional Return Value:  Point\|null Computes the pixel coordinates of the given geographical location in the DOM element that holds the draggable map. |
| getVisibleRegion | getVisibleRegion() Parameters:  None Return Value:  VisibleRegion\|null The visible region of the map. Returns null if the map has no size. Returns null if the OverlayView is on a StreetViewPanorama. |
| getWorldWidth | getWorldWidth() Parameters:  None Return Value:  number The width of the world in pixels in the current zoom level. For projections with a heading angle of either 90 or 270 degrees, this corresponds to the pixel span in the Y-axis. |
