AddressValidationRequest [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#AddressValidationRequest]
interface

google.maps.addressValidation.AddressValidationRequest
interface

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Request interface for AddressValidation.fetchAddressValidation [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#AddressValidation.fetchAddressValidation].
| Properties |
| --- |
| address | Type:  PostalAddressLiteral The address being validated. Unformatted addresses should be submitted via PostalAddress.addressLines. |
| placeAutocompleteElement optional | Type:  PlaceAutocompleteElement optional If using a PlaceAutocompleteElement, include it here to link the AddressValidation API calls with the autocomplete session token. |
| previousResponseId optional | Type:  string optional This field must not be set for the first address validation request. If more requests are necessary to fully validate a single address (for example if the changes the user makes after the initial validation need to be re-validated), then each followup request must populate this field with the AddressValidation.responseId from the very first response in the validation sequence. |

Address [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#Address]
class

google.maps.addressValidation.Address
class

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Details of the post-processed address. Post-processing includes correcting misspelled parts of the address, replacing incorrect parts, and inferring missing parts.
Access by calling const {Address} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |
| components | Type:  Array<AddressComponent> The individual address components of the formatted and corrected address, along with validation information. This provides information on the validation status of the individual components. |
| formattedAddress | Type:  string optional The post-processed address, formatted as a single-line address following the address-formatting rules of the region where the address is located. |
| missingComponentTypes | Type:  Array<string> The types of components that were expected to be present in a correctly formatted mailing address but were not found in the input AND could not be inferred. Components of this type are not present in formatted_address, postal_address, or address_components. An example might be ['street_number', 'route'] for an input like "Boulder, Colorado, 80301, USA". The list of possible types can be found here. |
| postalAddress | Type:  PostalAddress optional The post-processed address represented as a postal address. |
| unconfirmedComponentTypes | Type:  Array<string> The types of the components that are present in the address_components but could not be confirmed to be correct. This field is provided for the sake of convenience: its contents are equivalent to iterating through the address_components to find the types of all the components where the AddressComponent.confirmationLevel is not ConfirmationLevel.CONFIRMED or the AddressComponent.inferred flag is not set to true. The list of possible types can be found here. |
| unresolvedTokens | Type:  Array<string> Any tokens in the input that could not be resolved. This might be an input that was not recognized as a valid part of an address (for example in an input like "123235253253 Main St, San Francisco, CA, 94105", the unresolved tokens may look like ["123235253253"] since that does not look like a valid street number. |

AddressComponent [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#AddressComponent]
class

google.maps.addressValidation.AddressComponent
class

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Represents a single component of an address (ex. street name, city).
Access by calling const {AddressComponent} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].

| --- |
| componentName | Type:  string optional The component name text. For example, "5th Avenue" for a street name or "1253" for a street number, |
| componentNameLanguageCode | Type:  string optional The BCP-47 language code. This will not be present if the component name is not associated with a language, such as a street number. |
| componentType | Type:  string optional The type of the address component. See Table 2: Additional types returned by the Places service for a list of possible types. |
| confirmationLevel | Type:  ConfirmationLevel optional Indicates the level of certainty that the component is correct. |
| inferred | Type:  boolean If true, this component was not part of the input, but was inferred for the address location. Including this component is recommended for a complete address. |
| replaced | Type:  boolean Indicates the name of the component was replaced with a completely different one. For example, replacing a wrong postal code being with one that is correct for the address. This is not a cosmetic change; the input component has been changed to a different one. |
| spellCorrected | Type:  boolean Indicates a correction to a misspelling in the component name. The API does not always flag changes from one spelling variant to another, such as "centre" to "center". |
| unexpected | Type:  boolean If true, this component is not expected to be present in a postal address for the given region. It has been retained only because it was part of the input. |

ConfirmationLevel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#ConfirmationLevel]
constants

google.maps.addressValidation.ConfirmationLevel
constants

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
The different possible values indicating the level of certainty that the component is correct.
Access by calling const {ConfirmationLevel} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |

Contains information about the place the input was geocoded to.
Access by calling const {Geocode} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Properties |
| --- |
| bounds | Type:  LatLngBounds optional The bounds of the geocoded place. |
| featureSizeMeters | Type:  number optional The size of the geocoded place, in meters. This is another measure of the coarseness of the geocoded location, but in physical size rather than in semantic meaning. |
| location | Type:  LatLngAltitude optional The geocoded location of the input. |
| placeId | Type:  string optional The Place ID of the geocoded place. Using Place is preferred over using addresses, latitude/longitude coordinates, or plus codes. Using coordinates for routing or calculating driving directions will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates. This may not be a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination and may not be near an access point to the property. Additionally, when a location is reverse geocoded, there is no guarantee that the returned address will match the original. |
| placeTypes | Type:  Array<string> The type(s) of place that the input geocoded to. For example, ['locality', 'political']. The full list of types can be found in the Geocoding API documentation. |
| plusCode | Type:  PlusCode optional The plus code corresponding to the location. |
| Methods |
| --- |
| fetchPlace | fetchPlace() Parameters:  None Return Value:  None Returns a Place representation of this Geocode. To get full place details, a call to place.fetchFields() should be made. |

Granularity [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#Granularity]
constants

google.maps.addressValidation.Granularity
constants

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
The various granularities that an address or a geocode can have. When used to indicate granularity for an address, these values indicate with how fine a granularity the address identifies a mailing destination. For example, an address such as "123 Main Street, Redwood City, CA, 94061" identifies a PREMISE while something like "Redwood City, CA, 94061" identifies a LOCALITY. However, if we are unable to find a geocode for "123 Main Street" in Redwood City, the geocode returned might be of LOCALITY granularity even though the address is more granular.
Access by calling const {Granularity} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| BLOCK | The address or geocode indicates a block. Only used in regions which have block-level addressing, such as Japan. |
| OTHER | All other granularities, which are bucketed together since they are not deliverable. |
| PREMISE | Building-level result. |
| PREMISE_PROXIMITY | A geocode that approximates the building-level location of the address. |
| ROUTE | The geocode or address is granular to route, such as a street, road, or highway. |
| SUB_PREMISE | Below-building level result, such as an apartment. |

PossibleNextAction [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference/address-validation#PossibleNextAction]
constants

google.maps.addressValidation.PossibleNextAction
constants

Notice: Available only in the v=beta channel [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/versions#choosing-the-beta-channel].
Offers an interpretive summary of the API response, intended to assist in determining a potential subsequent action to take. This field is derived from other fields in the API response and should not be considered as a guarantee of address accuracy or deliverability.
Access by calling const {PossibleNextAction} = await google.maps.importLibrary("addressValidation"). See Libraries in the Maps JavaScript API [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/libraries].
| Constants |
| --- |
| ACCEPT | The API response does not contain signals that warrant one of the other PossibleNextAction values. You might consider using the post-processed address without further prompting your customer, though this does not guarantee the address is valid, and the address might still contain corrections. It is your responsibility to determine if and how to prompt your customer, depending on your own risk assessment. |
| CONFIRM | One or more fields of the API response indicate potential minor issues with the post-processed address, for example the postal_code address component was replaced. Prompting your customer to review the address could help improve the quality of the address. |
| CONFIRM_ADD_SUBPREMISES | The API response indicates the post-processed address might be missing a subpremises. Prompting your customer to review the address and consider adding a unit number could help improve the quality of the address. The post-processed address might also have other minor issues. Note: this enum value can only be returned for US addresses. |
| FIX | One or more fields of the API response indicate a potential issue with the post-processed address, for example the verdict.validation_granularity is OTHER. Prompting your customer to edit the address could help improve the quality of the address. |
