Both location and radius will be ignored if bounds is set. |
| componentRestrictions optional | Type:  ComponentRestrictions optional The component restrictions. Component restrictions are used to restrict predictions to only those within the parent component. For example, the country. |
| language optional | Type:  string optional A language identifier for the language in which the results should be returned, if possible. Results in the selected language may be given a higher ranking, but suggestions are not restricted to this language. See the list of supported languages. |
| location optional | Deprecated: location is deprecated as of May 2023. Use AutocompletionRequest.locationBias and AutocompletionRequest.locationRestriction instead. Type:  LatLng optional Location for prediction biasing. Predictions will be biased towards the given location and radius. Alternatively, bounds can be used. |
