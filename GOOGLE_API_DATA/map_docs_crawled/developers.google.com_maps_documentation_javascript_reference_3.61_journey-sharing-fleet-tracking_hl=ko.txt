interface

google.maps.journeySharing.FleetEngineDeliveryVehicleLocationProviderOptions
interface

Options for delivery vehicle location provider.
| Properties |
| --- |
| authTokenFetcher | Type:  AuthTokenFetcher Provides JSON Web Tokens for authenticating the client to Fleet Engine. |
| projectId | Type:  string The consumer's project ID from Google Cloud Console. |
| activePolylineCustomization optional | Type:  (function(DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|PolylineOptions optional Customization applied to the active polyline. An active polyline corresponds to a portion of the route the vehicle is currently traversing through.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as polyline color) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a PolylineOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the polyline after the polyline has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the polyline is created. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the polyline's coordinates change, or when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this polyline have changed.  See DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| deliveryVehicleId optional | Type:  string optional The delivery vehicle ID to track immediately after the location provider is instantiated. If not specified, the location provider does not start tracking any vehicle; use FleetEngineDeliveryVehicleLocationProvider.deliveryVehicleId to set the ID and begin tracking. |
| deliveryVehicleMarkerCustomization optional | Type:  (function(DeliveryVehicleMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|MarkerOptions optional Customization applied to the delivery vehicle marker.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as marker icon) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a MarkerOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the marker after the marker has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the marker is created, before it is added to the map view. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this marker have changed.  See DeliveryVehicleMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| plannedStopMarkerCustomization optional | Type:  (function(PlannedStopMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|MarkerOptions optional Customization applied to a planned stop marker.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as marker icon) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a MarkerOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the marker after the marker has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the marker is created, before it is added to the map view. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this marker have changed.  See PlannedStopMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| pollingIntervalMillis optional | Type:  number optional Minimum time between fetching location updates in milliseconds. If it takes longer than pollingIntervalMillis to fetch a location update, the next location update is not started until the current one finishes.  Setting this value to 0 disables recurring location updates. A new location update is fetched if any of the parameters observed by the location provider changes.  The default polling interval is 5000 milliseconds, the minimum interval. If you set the polling interval to a lower non-zero value, 5000 is used. |
| remainingPolylineCustomization optional | Type:  (function(DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|PolylineOptions optional Customization applied to the remaining polyline. A remaining polyline corresponds to a portion of the route the vehicle has not yet started traversing through.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as polyline color) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a PolylineOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the polyline after the polyline has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the polyline is created. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the polyline's coordinates change, or when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this polyline have changed.  See DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| shouldShowOutcomeLocations optional | Type:  boolean optional Boolean to show or hide outcome locations for the fetched tasks. |
| shouldShowTasks optional | Type:  boolean optional Boolean to show or hide tasks. Setting this to false will prevent the ListTasks endpoint from being called to fetch the tasks. Only the upcoming vehicle stops will be displayed. |
| staleLocationThresholdMillis optional | Type:  number optional Threshold for stale vehicle location. If the last updated location for the vehicle is older this threshold, the vehicle will not be displayed. Defaults to 24 hours in milliseconds. If the threshold is less than 0, or Infinity, the threshold will be ignored and the vehicle location will not be considered stale. |
| takenPolylineCustomization optional | Type:  (function(DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|PolylineOptions optional Customization applied to the taken polyline. A taken polyline corresponds to a portion of the route the vehicle has already traversed through.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as polyline color) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a PolylineOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the polyline after the polyline has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the polyline is created. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the polyline's coordinates change, or when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this polyline have changed.  See DeliveryVehiclePolylineCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| taskFilterOptions optional | Type:  FleetEngineTaskFilterOptions optional Filter options to apply when fetching tasks. The options can include specific vehicle, time, and task status. |
| taskMarkerCustomization optional | Type:  (function(TaskMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams): void)\|MarkerOptions optional Customization applied to a task marker. A task marker is rendered at the planned location of each task assigned to the delivery vehicle.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as marker icon) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a MarkerOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the marker after the marker has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the marker is created, before it is added to the map view. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.) Additionally, this function is invoked when the location provider receives data from Fleet Engine, regardless of whether the data corresponding to this marker have changed.  See TaskMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams for a list of supplied parameters and their uses. |
| taskOutcomeMarkerCustomization optional | Type:  function(TaskMarkerCustomizationFunctionParams): void optional Customization applied to a task outcome marker. A task outcome marker is rendered at the actual outcome location of each task assigned to the delivery vehicle.  Use this field to specify custom styling (such as marker icon) and interactivity (such as click handling). If a MarkerOptions object is specified, the changes specified in it are applied to the marker after the marker has been created, overwriting its default options if they exist. If a function is specified, it is invoked once when the marker is created, before it is added to the map view. (On this invocation, the isNew parameter in the function parameters object is set to true.)
