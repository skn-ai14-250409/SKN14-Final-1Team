The Routes API Compute Routes demo lets you
specify an origin and destination as a latitude/longitude coordinates pair or
as a place ID. To copy the latitude/longitude coordinates, find and click a
location on the map, and then paste the location into the form.

If you have an encoded polyline or a GeoJSON linestring, and you'd like to
view the polyline on map, go to
Interactive polyline decoder utility [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes/polylinedecoder].

After you select Get route, the demo displays the response from the
computeRoutes [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/routes/reference/rest/v2/TopLevel/computeRoutes] method as a route on
the map.
